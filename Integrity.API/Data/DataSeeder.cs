I grew up surrounded by creative people—family members who were tailors and fashion lovers—so I naturally developed a passion for styles, fabrics, and how clothing can make people feel confident and unique. In my free time, I enjoy sketching new outfit ideas, learning about different fabrics, and experimenting with styles that blend African culture with modern trends. One of my hobbies is visiting local markets to study traditional prints and textiles; I find inspiration in the stories behind every fabric design. I also like watching fashion shows and following trends from both Nigerian and international designers. Aside from fashion, I enjoy listening to Afrobeat music, spending time with my family, and exploring new places that spark creativity. I’m also pursuing additional education through the BYU-Pathway program, where I study business administration and tourism—knowledge that I believe will help me manage and grow a successful clothing brand in the future.

My ultimate ambition is to launch and grow my own clothing line that blends modern styles with traditional African influences, highlighting the richness of our heritage while meeting international fashion standards. I want my brand to stand for quality, authenticity, and sustainability. I also plan to create job opportunities for local tailors, fabric makers, and artisans, contributing to the growth of fashion entrepreneurship in Nigeria and beyond. In addition to fashion design, I am interested in expanding into fashion education and mentorship, helping young talents who lack access to formal training to develop their skills. I believe the future of the fashion industry lies in creativity, innovation, and ethical production practices, and I am committed to being a part of that positive change.
